The RIA Data Integration Hub, or DIH, is an implementation tool for end-to-end data migrations and integrations. Out of the box it is tailored for applications built on Oracleâ€™s Utilities Application Framework (OUAF) as it includes features specifically for that platform, but the underlying framework is generic and can be easily enhanced and adapted for any use case.
